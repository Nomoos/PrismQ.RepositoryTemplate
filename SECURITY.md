You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Updates**: We'll keep you informed about the progress of fixing the vulnerability
- **Disclosure**: We'll work with you to understand and resolve the issue promptly
- **Credit**: We'll credit you for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

When using this PrismQ module:

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository
   - Use environment variables (`.env` file)
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
   - Use secure key management systems in production

2. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies up to date
   - Run `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt` regularly
   - Monitor Dependabot alerts
   - Review dependency changes before updating

3. **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive resources
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Secure your GPU/compute resources
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

4. **Data Security**: Protect sensitive data
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Follow data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

5. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality standards
   - Use the provided linting and type checking tools
   - Review code changes carefully
   - Run security scans on dependencies
